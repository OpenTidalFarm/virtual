# Docker for FEniCS

`fenics-stable` contains the current FEniCS 1.6 binaries from official
Ubuntu PPA. `fenics-dev` provides the environment and scripts for building
FEniCS from git for development.

To use, simply execute `./fenics-stable` or `./fenics-dev` depending on
your need. The GUI is enabled by default. To run CLI-only, pass the "-c"
option to either scripts.
